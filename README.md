# Deployment

The following are the steps I went through to deploy my live site:

- The site was deployed using Heroku. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - 

- To Fork the repository:
  - On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository.
  - In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
  - Select an owner for the forked repository.
  - By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
  - Optionally, add a description of your fork.
  - Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork.
  - Click Create fork.

- To Clone the repository:
  - On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository.
  - Above the list of files, click the Code button.
  - Copy the URL for the repository.
  - Open Git Bash.
  - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
  - Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
  - Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

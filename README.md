# Destiny Text Adventure Game

Welcome to a Destiny Text Adventure Game! This game is built purely using Python. It's designed to be a fun "Choose your own adventure" game, with random luck elements and items. Based on the very popular game Destiny and Destiny 2, this text adventure will bring you through the first mission in the game, from waking on the Cosmodrome to getting you ship's engine to fly to the Tower. If you get a high luck score and you choose the correct path, you'll make it out alive!

# Features 

## Existing Features

### Game Start
![Start Screen Image](assets/documentation/start-screen.png)
- The first thing to load is a logo for the game, created with the [Pyfiglet Library](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/). This is a large Ascii text image, saying "Destiny RPG Game".
- Along with this is a small paragraph explaining the game and the story for any users that have no prior knowledge of the Destiny games.

### Classes and Subclasses
- The player will be asked to enter their name first and then they are given a choice of which Destiny Class they would like to be, as well as their subclass. These choices are then stored in a Google Sheets Worksheet, allowing this data to be pulled later on in the game to reference the player.
- Depending on their choices here, the game will later on pick a grenade ability of the element selected in a fight scene.

  - By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
  - Optionally, add a description of your fork.
  - Choose whether to copy only the default branch or all branches to the new fork.
  - Click Create fork.

- To Clone the repository:
  - On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository.
  - Above the list of files, click the Code button.
  - Copy the URL for the repository.
  - Open Git Bash.
  - Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
